# JouleWise Task Queue

This is the live queue for JouleWise work. When the user gives a new task, first
triage it here instead of assuming it should happen immediately.

## Intake Rule For New Tasks

For every new user task:

1. Read `RUN_STATE.md`.
2. Read this file.
3. Check `git status --short --branch`.
4. Review the last 2-3 commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -3`.
5. Check relevant handoffs in `docs/run_reports/`.
6. Decide whether the task is:
   - urgent workspace hygiene,
   - Phase 1 evidence work,
   - Phase 2 implementation prep,
   - later-phase research work,
   - documentation/reporting,
   - or unrelated/new scope.
7. Place or update the task in the queue with priority, rationale, evidence,
   and blockers.
8. If executing it now, say why it outranks the current top task.

## Priority Scale

- **P0 Safety**: prevents accidental data loss, bad commits, broken handoffs, or
  corrupted repo state.
- **P1 Phase Gate**: required to close the current phase or unblock the next
  phase responsibly.
- **P2 Next Slice**: next implementation slice after current phase gates are
  adequately planned or closed.
- **P3 Research Expansion**: useful experiment or feature, but not needed for
  current gate.
- **P4 Polish**: quality-of-life, dashboard polish, formatting, cleanup, or
  presentation work.

## Ranking Factors

Rank higher when a task:

- Prevents accidental loss or bad Git history.
- Produces evidence for the current phase exit checklist.
- Removes ambiguity for multiple later steps.
- Is required before physical hardware time is spent.
- Is cheap to verify and reduces future confusion.
- Matches the current phase better than jumping ahead.

Rank lower when a task:

- Depends on unavailable hardware or supervisor input.
- Is a later-phase feature.
- Adds polish before a runnable vertical slice exists.
- Produces code without a clear run-bundle or test artifact.

## Machine-State Lanes (adopted C-007, 2026-07-07)

Every task carries a lane; a session picks the top task COMPATIBLE with
its machine state, not the top task absolutely:

- **[QUIET-MAC]** — measurement campaigns only: no agent fleet, no Codex
  load, idle gate will flag contamination.
- **[AGENT]** — code, docs, feasibility spikes; safe during agent-heavy
  sessions.
- **[ED-EXTERNAL]** — needs the user: advisor, calendar, device access,
  purchases, destinations.

## Current Queue

| Rank | ID | Priority | Status | Task | Evidence / Acceptance |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P2-015 | P2 Next Slice | NEW (C-011: critique counter-review) [QUIET-MAC] | Detection-floor calibration campaign — idle-only repeats, no-op/tiny workloads, measured-window duration ladder (50ms→30s); runs FIRST in the same quiet window as 2M | Versioned calibration bundle set (strict-valid); `detection_floor_j` + `minimum_identifiable_window_s` per target/backend recorded in `docs/phase_2/detection_floor.md`; calibration manifest hash cited by later reports; phase-identifiability flags already mechanical (C-011 reducer change) |
| 2 | P2-006 | P2 Next Slice | UNBLOCKED; acceptance extended by C-011 [QUIET-MAC] | Homogeneous baselines (slice 2M) on the Mac target — two-model campaign on a QUIET machine, then `docs/phase_2/baseline_results.md` with variance + prefill/decode comparison (phase columns honor identifiability flags) | Campaign bundles born under the FIXED validator; pass `--strict`; run via the FAIL-CLOSED runner (per-member strict validation, idle-suspect waiver rule, campaign verdict = publishable) using the counterbalanced order manifest (C-011/D-014); claim wording per `docs/contracts/claims_ladder.md` (D-037); no-agent quiet lock (C-009 T5); corpus backed up per R-016; runs AFTER P2-015 in the same window |

## Current Do-Not-Do-Yet List

- (satisfied 2026-06-12) The mock bundle/reducer path and report generator
  now exist; dashboard/report work is no longer blocked.
- (satisfied 2026-06-12) The mock lifecycle is runnable, so live
  MLX/powermetrics implementation may proceed once its hardware gates open
  (P1-002 + D-016); follow `docs/phase_2/hardware_slice_implementation_guide.md`.
- (resolved 2026-06-12) Hailo feasibility has a verdict
  (`unsupported_workload`); do not implement a Hailo backend — report it as
  an applicability finding.
- Do not implement schema v0.2 before Phase 3 Stage 3.1 (design is fixed in
  D-008; implementation waits).
- Phase 3 DESK feasibility spikes (Stage 3.0.x) may run now — their gate
  (2G/2I + model) is open. Do not start Phase 3 DATA collection, hardware
  pairings, or borrow-window scheduling before 2M baselines and the Stage
  3.0 verdicts exist (C-007 wording fix; was previously stated as a
  blanket Phase 3 hold that contradicted the queue).
- Do not schedule the 3080 Ti borrow window before Stage 3.0 verdicts and the
  rehearsed runbook exist (R-006).
- Do not start Phase 3 live-split work (3.3) before offline replay (3.2) has
  produced data.
- Do not close D-016 (model selection) without P1-001 supervisor scope or an
  explicit user go-ahead.
- (satisfied 2026-07-06) Slice 2N landed; 2G/2H may start once their own
  gates (D-016 + `[mac]` install; privileged sample + D-004 sudoers) open —
  build on the post-2N seams (RunContext raw evidence, D-026 markers,
  D-027 rail rows, 2N.3 observed-token fallback).

## Queue Maintenance

At the end of substantial work:

- Update statuses in this file.
- Add new tasks discovered during the run.
- Move completed tasks below or mark them `done`.
- Update `RUN_STATE.md` with the next highest-ranked task.
