# JouleWise Run State

Last updated: 2026-07-09 (P2-034 broad campaign packs C-026: PR #39
merged — six packs, pack lint clean; pre-hardware campaign surface
COMPLETE. Earlier same day: C-025 wave 2 (PRs #33..#38, D-056..D-059),
C-024 wave 1 (PRs #29..#32, D-052..D-055), C-023 rigor review, C-022
CP-5 clearance; suite 877)

## Start Here For Every Big Run

Before starting substantial work:

1. Read this file.
2. Read `TASK_QUEUE.md`.
3. Read `AGENT_PLAN.md` (phase index) and the active phase's plan doc under
   `docs/phase_N/`; per-item status lives in the phase exit checklist
   (D-023).
4. Read `docs/planning_reflection_protocol.md`.
5. Check `docs/decision_log.md` before re-deciding anything; check
   `docs/risk_register.md` if starting a phase or a hardware-dependent task.
6. Check the last 2-3 commits with `git log --oneline --decorate -3`.
7. Check `git status --short --branch`.
8. Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` unless the task is docs-only.
9. Do not commit local deletions or unrelated changes unless the user asks.
10. Heartbeat rule (`docs/milestones.md`): if >14 days passed with no run
    report and no recorded break, start with a milestones + risk review.
11. Live MLX gates use the repo venv: `.venv/bin/python -m joulewise ...`
    (system python3 lacks mlx → `runtime_unavailable`).
12. If an `ACTIVE_STOP_CARD` exists below, it overrides every normal
    "restart", "next", queue, and mission pointer until explicitly cleared.

At the end of substantial work:

1. Update this file with what changed.
2. Update `TASK_QUEUE.md` with completed, added, or re-ranked tasks.
3. Add or update a detailed report in `docs/run_reports/`.
4. Record tests, commands, blockers, and the next best task.
5. Record new decision-log entries and any risk-register status changes.
6. Refresh `PROJECT_STATUS.md` if advisor-visible state changed.
7. Push green commits promptly (small doc/bookkeeping commits straight
   to main; multi-commit code series as branch + PR per D-031). Do not
   accumulate unpushed local state — the remote and the high-level docs
   (README, PROJECT_STATUS) are the user's and advisor's view.
8. Run a docs-consistency sweep before the final bookkeeping commit
   (delegate to a fast subagent): stale test counts, gate-state
   contradictions between prose summaries and checklist matrix rows,
   numbers cited in multiple places (C-002; D-023 extension).
   After any session that changed front-facing docs, REGENERATE and
   REDEPLOY the site so the public snapshot tracks the repo (C-012):
   `python3 scripts/build_site.py && python3 scripts/pack_capsule.py &&
   (cd site_capsule && npx lakebed deploy)`.
9. Call out any dirty working-tree state that should not be accidentally
   committed.

## ACTIVE_STOP_CARD

Status: **CLEARED 2026-07-09** by the CP-5 resume session. Every
clearance criterion was met: all three worktree diffs lead-gated
(envgate live-gated against the real affine mock bundle) and merged as
PRs #23/#24/#25; PR #22 merged after a fresh final-head pass; the
methodology synthesis and suite_next specs packet adjudicated (CP-6 in
the stream log); all accepted pre-campaign changes landed and merged
(PRs #26/#27/#28); both post-merge integration reviews CLEAN; queue
rank 0 closed. Full record:
`docs/run_reports/2026-07-09-cp5-resume.md`. No stop card is active.

## Current Project Status

**Suite BUILD session COMPLETE and MERGED (2026-07-08; C-017;
D-044..D-047).** The workload suite is now CODE, not contracts: P2-010a
generic substrate (PR #17: suite.py, run_suite protocol, mock+MLX
execution, BundleReader suite validation, reducer suite_metrics, strict
rollup provenance), P2-010b affine core + smoke manifest (PR #18,
promoted via #20 after a base-retarget slip), P2-012 phase-1 + P2-020
generator engine (PR #19: gensuite, six categories + five ids-native
sentinels). All 37 research-doc amendments adjudicated first (recorded
dispositions). Live-verified on real MLX at three code states; three
live-only defects caught and fixed at the lead gate. Post-merge
integration review: zero cross-stream defects.

**CP-5 RESUMED AND CLEARED (2026-07-09): pre-campaign review COMPLETE;
Window A is GO behind two queued campaign-time steps.** Seven PRs merged
(#22..#28): D-033 strict legacy-bypass close, envelope-gate script,
campaign-runner prompt-hash check, bundle-pack tooling, tokenizer
identity widening + manifest regen, capture hardening (output token IDs,
fail-closed sampler pin, model weight hashing, hash-domain
realized-vs-manifest closure), advisor status site + suite_next draft
specs (D-051). Suite 822 OK. Ed's four-part answer + Window-A go/no-go:
`docs/run_reports/2026-07-09-cp5-resume.md`.

**RESTART HERE (next agent):**
1. Read `docs/run_reports/2026-07-09-p2034-broad-packs.md` (latest) and
   `docs/run_reports/2026-07-09-cp5-resume.md` (Window-A go/no-go).
2. The pre-window AGENT backlog is CLEAR. Next work is machine-state
   dependent: [QUIET-MAC] quiet Window A (C-019 shakedown → P2-015
   floors → P2-006) is the top item; [AGENT] lanes next are P2-022 shim
   spike / P2-023 HumanEval import (post-2M gates — check queue) and
   P2-035 (after floors); [ED-EXTERNAL] items per queue.
3. Rotation (D-056), uncertainty gates (D-057), and the campaign packs
   are live for Window-A execution.

## Current Verification

- Main c095c83 (post PR #39; docs-only): suite `OK (skipped=10)` and
  repo lint errors=0, lead-run; pack lint errors=0 warnings=0.
- Prior: main after wave-2 integration fixes: `python3 -m unittest discover -s
  tests` → `Ran 877 tests, OK (skipped=10)`, lead-run; repo lint
  errors=0; CI green on all six PR heads (#33..#38); combined-ref
  pre-merge suite check green; live rotated mock campaign strict-valid
  with order provenance (lead-validated); mock e2e emits uncertainty
  fields per D-057.
- Prior: series head f75134d (post PRs #29..#32; docs-only) lead-verified;
  integration-fix commit 7156295 is also docs-only (no test surface):
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` → `Ran 822 tests, OK
  (skipped=10)`, lead-run; CI green on all four PR heads (py3.11+py3.14);
  integration reviewer independently re-ran the suite and recomputed the
  detection-floor campaign arithmetic.
- Prior verification (7666652, post PRs #22..#28): `Ran 822 tests, OK
  (skipped=10)`, lead-run.
- Live lead gates this session (real MLX, Qwen2.5-1.5B via `.venv`, mock
  telemetry): single-prompt + TWO full 48-item jw_mixed suite runs
  (pre-merge old manifests, then final merged main with the REGENERATED
  manifests) — all strict-valid; 48/48 hash-domain closures on the
  real tokenizer; output token ids, model artifact hash, pinned sampler,
  and package versions verified present in the bundles.
- Envelope gate live: honest `envelope_failed[E1]` on the mock affine
  bundle; refusals for wrong-profile/malformed/mixed inputs; exit codes
  0/2/3.
- Bundle pack live: pack → verify(0) → tamper → verify(2).
- Manifest regen: byte-identical double-regen; all realized counts 512;
  new effective shas 855be4e5 (mixed) / 0316283d (sentinel).
- CI green on every merged head (PR #27's first merge-ref run failed on
  a cross-branch fixture interaction; fixed test-side, then green).
- Post-merge integration reviews (both waves): CLEAN, incl. an
  end-to-end mock campaign → strict → envelope-gate → pack → verify flow
  and a D-033 legacy-identity spoof probe that failed closed.
- `validate-bundle --strict` green over all 6 real corpus bundles under
  the new era rule (PR #22 live gate: 6/6 valid, tamper fails named).

## Known Workspace State

- `main` pushed and current through this session's bookkeeping. No open
  PRs; no stream worktrees remain (all seven merged and removed).
- Codex's own worktree `/Users/edr/.codex/worktrees/7fe2/JouleWise`
  still holds the ORIGINAL advisor-site commits (bf9ffc5..e6cf431);
  their content landed via PR #28 (D-051 renumber applied). Safe to
  leave or remove; do not re-land.
- `/tmp/jw-lead-verify/` and the session scratchpad hold disposable
  lead-verification artifacts (live-runs bundles are not corpus).

## What Is Next

Follow `TASK_QUEUE.md` (lane-annotated). In order:

1. **Wave 2 [AGENT]** (queue ranks 0a-0d; C-024 handoff): P2-029
   reducer/aggregator uncertainty propagation, P2-030 ordering
   executability (pre-campaign blocker for suite claims), P2-031
   token-normalization contract + stack-identity table, P2-032
   pre-hardware campaign packs. (P2-015-PREP is DONE — the design landed
   as `docs/phase_2/detection_floor.md` with the false-effect guard
   floor, D-054.)
2. **Quiet Window A** [QUIET-MAC]: C-019 shakedown first, then P2-015
   floors, then P2-006 2M baselines; AP-6 sentinel pilot may ride the
   window tail (manifests are ready).
3. **Ed's external one-pass** [ED-EXTERNAL]: calendar, device access,
   borrow window, wall meter, backup destination (P0-003); plus P2-027
   external re-reduction party selection.
4. **3.0.2 llama.cpp spike** [AGENT after R-003 approval].

Hardware-gated (unchanged): 2K/2L (P1-006), wall meter (P1-003),
topology (P1-004), calendar mapping (P1-008).

## Open Decisions And Blockers

- Supervisor approval and scope pending (P1-001, R-001 — mitigation
  holding); gates FULL D-016 closure.
- Real backup destination pending (P0-003; interim same-disk active).
- Calendar dates pending (P1-008, R-012).
- Wall-meter decision pending (P1-003, R-007).
- Physical network topology pending (P1-004, R-011).
- NVIDIA/Orin access evidence pending (P1-006; gates 2K/2L).
- Git author identity on this machine auto-selected as
  `Ed R <edr@Eds-MacBook-Pro.local>`. Amend future commits if a
  different identity is needed.
