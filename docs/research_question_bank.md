# Research Question Bank

Candidate research questions the instrument can answer, beyond the named
set in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`. Populated from council sessions C-003/C-004
(2026-07-07; see `docs/council_log.md` for positions and votes). Promotion
out of the bank requires: a named RQ slot in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, a data
plan that does not displace queue ranks above it, and (post P1-001) scope
fit. Killed ideas stay recorded with their cause of death.

## Promoted 2026-07-07 (now Q4-Q6 in PROJECT_STATUS)

- **Q4 Fixed-vs-marginal energy model** — fit
  `E = fixed + prefill(prompt_tokens) + decode(output_tokens)` per
  target/model/quantization; predicts which workloads flatter which
  devices and enables compositional split-energy prediction (predict
  split-run energy from monolithic coefficients + transfer measurements,
  validate on a subset) — the method that makes Q1 answerable at scale.
  Subsumes the prefill-scaling-exponent question.
- **Q5 Ranking stability** — do device rankings survive workload changes
  (prompt/output/quantization regimes), or where do they flip? Uses the 2M
  matrix directly.
- **Q6 Boundary sensitivity** — do conclusions change when measured at
  platform rails vs AC wall power? (Gated on the wall meter, P1-003/R-007;
  reframes calibration as a research result.)

## Methodology centerpiece (deliberately NOT a numbered RQ — C-003 vote)

- **Detection floor / noise floor**: the smallest idle-subtracted energy
  difference each target/telemetry backend can honestly resolve. Observed
  motivation: idle baseline stddev (5.4 W) exceeded its mean (3.5 W) in
  the first real capture. Pairs with the reducer feature all council
  members converged on: **phase/item identifiability flags** (windows with
  fewer than N samples report a flag, not a bare joule value).

## Banked (viable, not yet promoted)

- **Dark silicon / rail utilization**: what fraction of a SoC's rails does
  a runtime energize? (Measured: ANE at 0.0 W through 512 tokens of MLX
  decode — the most quotable standalone finding to date.)
- **CPU:GPU energy division by phase**: does the rail mix shift between
  compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode? Upstream of split
  economics.
- **KV-growth decode drift**: does per-token energy rise with sequence
  position? Valid only in CHUNKED form — token cadence (~4 ms) far
  outruns the power sampler (~113 ms); no per-token joule claims.
- **Cooldown recovery as thermal characterization**: recovery time vs
  preceding run intensity; cap-hit rates (observed: one 305 s cap-hit vs a
  117 s recovery in the first flagship experiment).
- **Failure frontier**: structured `unsupported` bundles as data — which
  model/quant/context combinations fit, fail, or throttle. Competitors
  discard their failures.
- **Cold-start / keep-warm energy**: model-load joules and the reload-vs-
  resident breakeven. Needs sampling outside the current measured window
  (harness extension).
- **Energy-per-correct-answer vs difficulty** (C-004): instrumented by the
  `affine_mod_ladder_v1` scored workload profile (see below). Claim shape
  pinned by the council: "energy per correct answer rises as accuracy
  falls under a controlled per-attempt energy envelope" — difficulty is
  DESIGNED to hold token budget approximately constant, and observed
  token/stop-reason distributions must be reported to verify residual
  EOS/output-length effects are negligible (wrong-answers-terminate-early
  would bias the curve's magnitude). NOT "difficulty causes energy."
- **Speculative-decoding energy**: joules per accepted token with/without
  a draft model. Needs runtime support + quality-equivalence controls.
- **Power-mode Pareto**: energy-latency tradeoff across OS power modes;
  wait until power mode is a first-class config/environment field.
- **Deferred (C-003/C-004 unanimous): general joules-per-solved-task /
  intelligence-per-joule** — drags in accuracy-evaluation policy before
  the measurement dataset matures, and sits in Intelligence per Watt's
  lane where JouleWise is least differentiated. The quarantined ladder
  profile above is the minimal version that survives.

## Instrument expansions adopted by C-004 (queue P2-009 / P2-010)

- **P2-009 rich telemetry (land FIRST — zero capture cost):** parse the
  already-captured-but-discarded plist fields — per-cluster E/P-core DVFS
  residency histograms, per-core frequencies/idle/parking, GPU
  freq/dvfm_states/idle_ratio/sw-requested-vs-achieved state, vendor
  combined_power as a cross-check — plus per-bundle environment snapshots
  (battery/charger state, Low Power Mode, memory pressure, load, display
  state; all sudo-free). Evidence this matters: decode pins the GPU at
  1380 MHz / idle_ratio 0.0 / ~22 W, and the contaminated idle window was
  mechanically visible in `gpu.idle_ratio` (first half at 13 W / 1363 MHz
  before true idle) — parsing it turns our contamination anecdote into an
  automated idle-quality gate. Opt-in `rich_telemetry` tier later: the
  `tasks` sampler (per-process attribution — the direct answer to
  background contamination), disk/network samplers.
- **P2-010 scored workload suite v1:** `affine_mod_ladder_v1` per the
  C-004 design (seed-deterministic SHA-256-derived modular recurrences;
  difficulty = iteration count with prompt shape and answer length fixed;
  exact-integer scoring; levels 1..64 powers-of-two, 16 items/level;
  suite-per-bundle with item/level marker events; level-window energy
  primary; per-item flagged unidentifiable below minimum samples;
  correctness lives in stdlib `joulewise/workloads.py`, scored by the
  reducer so summaries stay re-reducible). Quarantine rules (C-004):
  one optional workload profile, correctness as annotation, no
  "difficulty causes energy" claims.


# Hardware-gated research agenda — steelmanned potential (Council C-005)

Drafted 2026-07-07 by council C-005 (session shape B; see
`docs/council_log.md` C-005 for positions, adjudications, and dissents).
Format follows `docs/research_question_bank.md`: candidate questions, not
promotions — promotion still requires a named RQ slot in
`PROJECT_STATUS.md`, a data plan that does not displace queue ranks, and
scope fit. IDs here are `C5-<tier>.<n>` to avoid colliding with Q1-Q6.

Every question below survived a devil's-advocate (examiner) round; the
scoping is deliberate, not decorative. Standing kills re-affirmed and
inherited by everything here: no per-token joule claims (~9 Hz sampler vs
~4 ms token cadence — chunked windows only), no unqualified absolute-joule
claims from modeled rails, no general intelligence-per-joule, claim
wording "on this M3 Max / MLX / powermetrics" until a second unit or lab
exists, and present-tense capability claims only for landed code (P2-010 scored suite is QUEUED,
not landed (D-014/P2-011 aggregation and P2-009 telemetry LANDED 2026-07-07)).

## Why this instrument matters (steelman preamble, examiner-scoped)

**Auditability is the differentiator, not topic novelty.** Energy
benchmarks exist (MLPerf Power; TokenPowerBench; ML.ENERGY-style
datacenter work) — what does not exist is local-inference joules/token
that a skeptic can re-derive: JouleWise publishes self-contained bundles
where config, raw power trace, vendor telemetry, event log, and outputs
are preserved and `validate-bundle --strict` proves the summary re-reduces
identically from raw evidence. Energy tables are otherwise unauditable at
exactly the step that matters.

**Energy per request is becoming the binding constraint on local AI.**
Battery, thermal envelope, and sustained throughput all reduce to joules
per completed request. Latency says whether a local model feels fast
once; `energy_request_j` with uncertainty says whether it can run all day.
The instrument already resolves this at CV 0.3-1.4% across repetitions.

**Apple-Silicon unified memory is a clean window into the memory-bound
decode regime.** The measured 1.5B vs 122B-MoE pair showed energy/token
numerically aligning with the active-parameter ratio while decode power
stayed nearly flat (~23.5 → ~27.5 W). That is hypothesis-generating, not
a scaling result (see C5-1.1), but it demonstrates that the instrument can
see the shape of the regime that throughput benchmarks cannot.

**Negative results are structured data.** did-not-fit, throttle,
contaminated-idle, and cap-hit outcomes produce complete `unsupported` or
quality-flagged bundles. Competitors discard their failures; here the
feasibility frontier is itself a reportable dataset (this is how a
negative Hailo verdict stays a finding).

**The benchmark can referee efficiency claims.** Quantization, runtime,
and architecture "efficiency" claims mix latency, memory, and energy with
no common accounting. Typed configs + one reducer + named measurement
boundaries make within-boundary refereeing possible today and boundary-
labeled cross-target comparisons possible with planned hardware.

**Q4's fixed-vs-marginal model turns benchmark data into engineering
budgets.** `E = fixed + prefill(p) + decode(d)` per target/model/quant
lets an app team budget a workload distribution (an agent session, a RAG
pipeline) from benchmark coefficients — the bridge from instrument to
battery-life engineering.

**The split study is a first-of-kind edge measurement.** Prefill/decode
disaggregation is argued from datacenter throughput; nobody has measured
the ENERGY crossover on local links with both-end power sampling and
per-stage decomposition (prefill/serialize/transfer/deserialize/decode).
Either verdict — crossover exists or doesn't in range — is publishable.
(Examiner note, recorded as standing tension: this is also the most
hardware-gated item in the agenda; the feasibility-first Phase 3 ladder
is the mitigation.)

**The infrastructure outlives any single result.** Every future target is
forced through the same contract (config → bundle → strict re-reduction →
boundary-named summary). The M3 Max numbers are the demo; the reusable
referee is the contribution.

## TIER 1 — answerable with current hardware (M3 Max alone)

Landed software (P2-009 rich telemetry, P2-011 uncertainty
aggregation, 2M campaign tooling — all 2026-07-07) is available;
queued software (P2-010 scored suite) is assumed where noted; no new
hardware. Throughput reality: ~30-75 bundles/hour makes n=10-20 designs
cheap.

- **C5-1.1 Active-parameter energy scaling (the honest version of the
  122B observation).** Does decode energy/token scale with active rather
  than total parameters across dense and MoE models on one pinned stack?
  Measure: decode-window idle-subtracted joules, mean power, throughput
  across 4-6 model points (dense 1.5B/7B/14B bridge + ≥2 MoE), same quant
  recipe, pinned MLX version, fixed shapes, n≥5 interleaved; fit
  mJ/token ~ active_params (+ total-param/KV covariates) with intervals.
  Hardware: now. Methodology: runtime is part of the condition — rerun
  after MLX updates as a separate condition. Threat: model families
  differ in more than active params; the dense bridge and quant pinning
  carry the inference. Who cares: efficient-ML and MoE architecture
  researchers; local-inference benchmark authors.

- **C5-1.2 Context-length energy scaling.** Where does measured energy
  stop being linear in prompt length? Measure: prefill/decode energy over
  prompt 128→8192 (fixed decode 64/256), n≥5; unsupported cells recorded.
  Hardware: now. Methodology: chunked windows; short-prompt prefill
  reported "unresolved at sampler resolution", never 0.03 J-style point
  claims. Threat: SoC boundary underrepresents unified-memory traffic —
  directional bias for long-context (examiner #11); flag pending Q6
  calibration. Who cares: long-context model teams, serving researchers.

- **C5-1.3 Phase-resolved compute-vs-memory signatures (uses landed P2-009 telemetry).**
  Does the rail mix and DVFS residency shift between compute-bound
  prefill and memory-bound decode, and how does the shift move with model
  size/quant? Measure: per-phase CPU:GPU energy division, GPU
  frequency/dvfm residency, idle_ratio across the 2M matrix. Hardware:
  now. Methodology: promotes the banked "CPU:GPU division by phase" item
  with the telemetry that makes it cheap. Threat: modeled rails — claims
  are about STRUCTURE (ratios, shifts), not absolute rail watts. Who
  cares: Apple/Metal/MLX performance engineers, systems-paper authors.

- **C5-1.4 DVFS residency as a throttling early-warning (uses landed P2-009 telemetry).**
  Do residency histograms and idle_ratio drift predict throttling before
  energy/throughput visibly degrade under sustained inference? Measure:
  20-60 min sustained blocks; per-rep energy, residency, cap-hit rates,
  recovery slopes; n≥5 blocks. Hardware: now. Methodology: cooldown-gate
  records and interleaving separate warmup, drift, and throttling.
  Threat: one chassis/ambient; report as within-target characterization.
  Who cares: laptop-inference tool builders, mobile/edge systems
  researchers, thermal-management teams.

- **C5-1.5 Cooldown-recovery curves and the energy tail (promotes banked
  item).** Recovery time and excess idle joules vs preceding run
  intensity; is the tail material to honest energy/request accounting?
  Measure: post-run recovery traces after an intensity ladder; time-to-
  baseline, cap-hit rate, excess joules; n≥5. Hardware: now. Threat:
  ambient sensitivity — record environment snapshots (P2-009). Who
  cares: on-device serving teams, benchmark methodology authors.

- **C5-1.6 Sampling-strategy energy overhead (power-gated).** Does
  temperature/top-p/beam sampling cost measurable energy beyond
  deterministic decoding at fixed output length? Measure: greedy vs
  sampled at fixed decode caps, recorded stop reasons; PRECONDITION:
  measured detection floor first; n≥10 paired ABBA. Hardware: now.
  Threat: plausibly below floor at n=5 — the null ("sampler choice is
  energy-free at this resolution") is the likely and still-reportable
  result. Who cares: runtime maintainers, generation-defaults tuning.

- **C5-1.7 Keep-warm vs reload breakeven (promotes banked cold-start
  item; harness extension).** Model-load joules, resident idle-power
  delta, cold-vs-warm TTFT → breakeven interarrival time per
  model/quant. Measure: load-window sampling (extension: measure outside
  current window), idle-resident deltas, n≥5. Hardware: now. Threat:
  idle-resident delta may be near the detection floor for small models;
  report identifiability. Who cares: desktop-assistant and agent-
  framework teams, serverless-inference researchers.

- **C5-1.8 Runtime energy attribution.** How much of measured inference
  energy belongs to the runtime, not the model? Same model artifact
  (where format permits) across MLX vs llama.cpp-Metal vs ollama on the
  same machine. Measure: energy/token, power, TTFT, rail mix over a
  shared shape grid, n≥5; artifact hashes and versions pinned. Hardware:
  now. Methodology: where formats force different artifacts (MLX vs
  GGUF), the comparison is stack-vs-stack, stated as such. Threat:
  version churn — this question is BUILT on the pinning discipline
  rather than wounded by it. Who cares: runtime maintainers, local-LLM
  users, model publishers choosing release formats.

- **C5-1.9 MoE-vs-dense energy per correct answer, quarantined (needs
  P2-010).** Under the controlled-envelope ladder, do MoE and dense
  models at similar quality bands differ in energy per correct answer?
  Measure: affine_mod_ladder_v1 level-window energy + exact scoring;
  token/stop-reason distributions reported (EOS-bias audit). Hardware:
  now. Methodology: C-004 quarantine binds — correctness is an
  annotation; claim template "on this controlled ladder", never
  intelligence-per-joule. Who cares: MoE architecture teams, benchmark-
  methodology reviewers.

- **C5-1.10 The failure frontier as an energy dataset (promotes banked
  item).** Which model × quant × context cells fit, fail, swap, or
  throttle on 128 GB unified memory — with pre-failure energy and memory
  pressure recorded? Measure: full matrix including structured
  `unsupported` bundles, env snapshots. Hardware: now. Threat: one
  memory configuration; frame as the 128 GB-class frontier. Who cares:
  model release engineers, hardware buyers, benchmark authors.

- **C5-1.11 Dark-silicon rail utilization, systematized (promotes banked
  item; needs P2-009).** What fraction of the SoC's rails does each
  runtime/model pair energize (ANE-dark being the first quotable
  instance)? Measure: per-rail energy share and residency by phase
  across the runtime grid of C5-1.8. Hardware: now. Threat: modeled
  rails — report utilization structure, cross-checked against vendor
  combined_power. Who cares: accelerator vendors, runtime implementers.

- **C5-1.12 Quantization benefit decomposition, Mac leg.** For MLX quant
  variants of one family (4/8-bit), how much energy benefit is lower
  power vs shorter time? Measure: decode energy, mean power, throughput
  per quant at fixed shapes, n≥5. Hardware: now (extends to Tier 2 for
  CUDA/GGUF legs). Threat: quant recipes change outputs — greedy-diff
  and report divergence. Who cares: quantization researchers, edge
  deployment teams.

## Workload/query-set expansion (first-class topic, Tier 1 hardware)

Today's workloads are single-prompt fixed-shape grids plus the queued
affine ladder. The council's workload lens designed the expansion; the
examiner frame was applied up front: at fixed token shape, most category
differences may collapse into token counts — that null is itself a
publishable result, named here the **Token-Shape Sufficiency Null**.

**Category taxonomy and expected energy mechanisms.** Six categories,
each with a mechanistic reason energy could differ and an honest
distinguishability call:
chat/instruction (high output-length variance under natural EOS; expected
NULL at fixed shape — the ecological baseline); code generation
(decode-heavy, distinct stop-reason behavior; near-null at fixed budget
unless tokenizer throughput differs on code tokens); summarization/
long-context (prefill-heavy, KV growth — YES, distinguishable via prefill
energy/TTFT/phase mix); reasoning/CoT (thinking-token inflation on
reasoning models — YES, the category effect most likely to be large,
directly measurable on the already-benchmarked Qwen3.5-122B); structured
JSON extraction (early valid-close stops make short answers cheap —
collapses at fixed envelope; probes EOS bias); multilingual (tokenizer
fertility differs sharply by script — YES when semantically matched,
expected null when token-matched; run BOTH, the pair separates fertility
from semantics).

**Realistic-vs-synthetic discipline (hybrid, both by design).**
Deterministic seed-derived synthetic profiles are the CONTROLS
(reproducible, shape-matched, redistribution-safe); pinned realistic
exemplars are the ecological probes (licensing/contamination/tokenizer
caveats recorded per source). Every realistic category runs in two modes:
`fixed_budget_exact` (greedy, EOS suppressed, fixed max_tokens — the
headline category-at-fixed-shape comparison) and `natural_eos` (greedy,
EOS allowed, stop reasons recorded — the operational-cost view). EOS-bias
rule inherited from C-004: natural termination is a workload property,
not a fairness control; wrong/short/refusal answers looking energy-cheap
must be visible in stop-reason distributions, never hidden.

**Sources to pin (hash-manifested frozen subsets, never "latest split"):**
LMSYS-Chat-1M for chat SHAPE distributions (terms-gated, not for
redistribution — derive synthetic shapes from it); HumanEval/MBPP-style
code prompts (MIT, contaminated — prompt exemplars only, no accuracy
claims); public-domain/government texts + synthetic needle controls for
summarization; GSM8K/MMLU-style items for reasoning shapes (MIT on HF,
contaminated — shape not correctness); synthetic fixed-schema records for
JSON; FLORES-200 for multilingual (CC BY-SA, parallel sentences enable
the semantic-matched leg). Where licenses are uncertain, synthetic wins.

**Concrete recommendation — `jw_mixed_v1` (adopt as the first official
workload expansion).** 6 categories × 8 items = 48 items per
target/model/quant, n=5, greedy `fixed_budget_exact` policy, categories
interleaved round-robin: chat 512/256; code 4×512/256 + 4×1024/512;
summarization 4096/256; reasoning 512/512; JSON extraction 1024/128;
multilingual FLORES 8 languages semantic-matched then token-matched
512/256. Sizing: 240 bundles ≈ 3-8 hours per target/model/quant at
observed throughput. `jw_mixed_v1_natural_eos` runs first as a
2-item/category PILOT (full dual-policy doubles the campaign; earn it
after fixed-budget traces are stable). Harness needs (all additive):
`workload_profile.category` + `source_manifest` + sha256 + per-item
`output_policy` fields; category as a campaign-matrix axis alongside
shape (never instead of it); per-item stop reason/emitted-token/response
hash in outputs; reuse P2-010 item windows + identifiability flags;
aggregation waits on P2-011. Out of scope stays out: no accuracy evals,
no judges, no retries — correctness only as quarantined annotation.

**Questions it unlocks (Tier 1):**

- **C5-W.1 Does category explain energy beyond token counts?** Paired
  synthetic controls vs realistic exemplars at identical shape; either a
  category effect or the Token-Shape Sufficiency Null — both reportable.
  Threat: small deltas need the detection floor first (examiner #2).
  Who cares: benchmark authors, app engineers budgeting features.
- **C5-W.2 Does thinking-token inflation dominate reasoning-model request
  energy?** Fixed-budget vs natural-EOS on the reasoning flagship;
  measures the energy price of "thinking" as output-length inflation.
  Who cares: reasoning-model teams, agent builders choosing modes.
- **C5-W.3 Is category energy-ranking stable across models and quants?**
  The workload-axis analogue of Q5; do code/long-context/reasoning flip
  the ordering? Who cares: procurement, model-selection tooling.
- **C5-W.4 Tokenizer fertility as an energy tax.** Semantic-matched vs
  token-matched multilingual pairs isolate joules attributable to
  tokenizer choice per script. Who cares: multilingual deployment,
  tokenizer designers.


## TIER 2 — unlocked by already-planned hardware gates

Gates by name: P1-006 device access (owned RTX 3050; Jetson Orin Nano),
the 3080 Ti borrow window (Phase 3 interconnect sweep only), P1-003 wall
meter decision (R-007), P1-004 network topology (1GbE / 2.5GbE / optional
10GbE).

- **C5-2.1 Quantization decomposition, cross-stack.** C5-1.12 extended
  to llama.cpp-CUDA/vLLM on the 3050: is the time-vs-watts split of
  quantization benefit hardware-dependent? Gate: P1-006. Threat:
  nvidia-smi board boundary ≠ SoC boundary — within-target decomposition
  first, cross-target only boundary-labeled. Who cares: quantization and
  runtime teams.

- **C5-2.2 Batch size and the prefill/decode energy split.** Does
  batching reshape energy/request and the phase split under an
  interactive latency bound? Measure: batch 1-8, joules/request +
  latency distribution, memory-fit failures recorded. Gate: P1-006
  (vLLM/llama.cpp batching; MLX support permitting). Who cares: serving
  researchers, scheduler developers.

- **C5-2.3 Predicted-vs-measured KV economics.** Does the analytic
  kv-size model predict serialized cache size, transfer energy, and
  deserialize energy? Measure: transfer joules/GiB both ends over
  payload ladder 16 MiB-2 GiB per link; deserialize windows; predicted
  vs actual deltas calibrate the model. Gates: P1-004 links + any second
  node (P1-006). Methodology: both-end sampling, clock-offset bounds
  flagged; this is the instrument's designed home turf. Who cares:
  disaggregated-inference researchers, KV-cache system builders.

- **C5-2.4 KV-cache quantization end-to-end.** Does q8_0 cache save
  energy after serialize/deserialize overhead, or only bytes? Gates:
  P1-006 + P1-004 (llama.cpp cache portability spike verdict). Who
  cares: llama.cpp maintainers, KV-compression researchers.

- **C5-2.5 Speculative decoding joules per ACCEPTED token (promotes
  banked item).** With/without draft model at output equivalence.
  Measure: total joules, acceptance rate, joules/accepted-token, n≥5.
  Gate: runtime support (MLX or 3050 stack). Methodology: the
  accepted-token denominator is the trap the harness's token accounting
  defuses. Who cares: speculative-decoding researchers, runtime teams.

- **C5-2.6 Energy-optimal request coalescing under a latency bound.**
  Replayed arrival traces × coalescing windows → joules/request vs
  p95 latency Pareto. Gate: P1-006. Who cares: edge gateways, serving
  schedulers.

- **C5-2.7 Device perf/W rankings with runtime held constant (extends
  Q5, doesn't duplicate it).** Same llama.cpp build/model/quant across
  M3 Max / 3050 / Orin (+3080 Ti in window): do rankings survive
  workload changes when the RUNTIME variable is removed? Gates: P1-006,
  borrow window. Threat: boundary heterogeneity — ranking claims are
  per-boundary until wall-calibrated (C5-2.9). Who cares: hardware
  reviewers, edge procurement.

- **C5-2.8 Placement-policy optimality from Q4 coefficients.** Can
  fitted fixed+marginal coefficients + measured transfer costs choose
  the energy-optimal prefill/decode placement, validated against
  measured splits? Gates: full Phase 3 set (P1-006, P1-004, borrow
  window). Methodology: modeled-vs-measured labeled; composite bundles.
  Who cares: disaggregated-serving and placement-policy researchers.

- **C5-2.9 Local-vs-datacenter crossover economics (survivor of the
  carbon-label kill).** When is a local request energy-cheaper than
  shipping it out — full-system watts, transfer included, datacenter
  side as DOCUMENTED published-figure assumptions, never measured-
  equivalent? Gates: P1-003 wall meter (+P1-004 for transfer leg).
  Methodology: the wall meter is what makes the local side full-system
  honest; boundary-directional bias (examiner #11) is why SoC rails
  alone can't carry this. Who cares: sustainability-of-ML community,
  enterprise local-vs-cloud deciders.

- **C5-2.10 Boundary-directional bias quantification (elevates Q6).**
  Not just "does the boundary change conclusions" but WHICH comparisons
  flip: memory-heavy vs compute-heavy conditions should diverge
  rail-vs-wall differently. Gate: P1-003. Methodology: pairs with
  C5-1.2/C5-2.3 threat notes; turns their caveat into a measured
  correction. Who cares: every downstream consumer of cross-target
  numbers; measurement-methodology reviewers.

## TIER 3 — requiring new acquisitions (hardware class + rough cost tier)

- **C5-3.1 Machine-to-machine variance / generalizability floor.** A
  second M-series unit (used M1/M2/M4, ~$500-1500) answers the
  examiner's sharpest structural attack: which Tier-1 findings replicate
  on a second box, and what is unit-to-unit variance relative to the
  detection floor? Also unlocks chassis-thermal comparisons (Air vs Pro
  fanless/fanned envelopes). This is the cheapest purchase that converts
  "on this M3 Max" claims into population claims.

- **C5-3.2 Battery-path energy and modeled-rail validation.** A USB-C PD
  power analyzer (~$100-300) measures DC input on battery-excluded runs
  and cross-checks powermetrics' modeled rails at a second physical
  boundary — a cheap partial answer to the modeled-vs-measured attack,
  complementary to the AC wall meter.

- **C5-3.3 Cross-ISA NPU/SoC comparison.** AMD Ryzen-AI mini-PC and/or
  Snapdragon-X laptop (~$800-2000 each): do the dark-silicon and
  active-param-scaling structures hold beyond Apple's stack? Requires
  one new telemetry adapter per platform (the adapter contract is the
  deliverable that makes this tractable).

- **C5-3.4 Phone-class edge inference.** One flagship phone
  (~$800-1200) + llama.cpp/MLX-swift: the actual battery-constrained
  edge story. Honest note: telemetry access on phones is the hard part;
  a feasibility verdict (possibly `unsupported`) is itself the
  publishable first result, exactly like Hailo.

- **C5-3.5 Cross-lab replication (zero hardware, the credibility
  acquisition).** A second lab runs the frozen suite from published
  bundles + configs. Gates every public-facing application (leaderboard,
  standard, audit service); costs coordination, not money.

## Unexpected-applications shortlist (beyond papers)

Ranked by usefulness × lowest extra work; every public-facing one carries
the internal-first ladder from the examiner round.

1. **Prompt/template energy profiler** — product engineers measure the
   joule cost of system-prompt/RAG-template variants; ~3-8 person-days
   (prompt-matrix configs + diff report); rides per-request joules +
   phase attribution. Available now.
2. **Attach-a-bundle power-bug repro** — runtime maintainers receive
   "model got slow/hot" reports as reproducible bundles; ~5-10 days
   (issue template + doc); rides bundle completeness. Available now;
   mundane and high-leverage.
3. **CI energy-regression gates** for MLX/llama.cpp — nightly pinned-host
   run fails on mJ/token regressions; ~5-15 days; rides strict
   validation + config hashing. PRECONDITIONS (examiner): measured
   detection floor as the threshold unit, env snapshots (P2-009),
   baseline-refresh policy across OS updates.
4. **Vendor/press claim audit** — "efficient" claims answered with
   boundary-named measured bundles; ~5-10 days. Defensible as "on this
   boundary, this workload"; overclaims if framed as absolute device
   energy without wall calibration.
5. **Practitioner energy model cards / leaderboard** — joules/token with
   uncertainty next to quality scores; ~5-10 days internal. Ladder:
   internal table → published methodology → cross-lab public table
   (C5-3.5); public version is KILLED until then.
6. **OS/driver/runtime update forensics** — before/after bundles detect
   power-behavior regressions from macOS/MLX updates (DVFS residency
   makes it mechanistic); ~5-15 days; stronger with landed P2-009 rich telemetry.
7. **Teaching instrument** — a measurement-methodology lab course (idle
   subtraction, boundaries, uncertainty, negative results) with bundles
   as graded artifacts; ~5-12 days.
8. **Bundle contract as a standards contribution** — the run-bundle
   layout + boundary table + strict validator packaged as a proposed
   artifact format for edge-LLM energy (MLPerf-Power-adjacent); ~15-30
   days. Export the methodology; do not claim to BE the standard.

Deferred/killed applications: carbon LABELS (needs wall meter + grid
assumptions; see C5-2.9 for the surviving question), battery-runtime
estimates without system-level calibration, local-vs-cloud ROUTING as a
product (cloud side unmeasurable today).
