## Findings

### F1 — Live-ledger bookending is not yet armable (blocker)

D-116’s issued ledger is the correct trust root, and D-117 correctly requires fresh live pre/post observations. The obstacle is mechanical: the present append path requires the physical ledger head to match the committed pin when reserving an attempt. Once the pre observation is finalized, that equality no longer holds for an ordinary post reservation.

The best design is an atomic `calibration_window_bracket_session.v1` capability:

1. At the pre-bookend, under a clean committed head, append one receipt reserving exactly two immutable slots: `pre` and `post`, each with its attempt ID, plan ID/SHA, evidence-root ID, expected time role, and shared session ID.
2. Finalize the pre slot before member one.
3. Leave the post slot prospectively open without treating it as an unresolved candidate or permitting claim evaluation.
4. Finalize or explicitly abort the post slot at the closing bookend.
5. Commit the terminal ledger head once, then issue an exact `calibration_bracket_binding.v1` mapping the frozen plan and evidence root to the two finalized content/receipt digests.
6. Candidate discovery still examines the complete live candidate universe; the binding selects the claimed pair but cannot hide extra candidates.

This is preferable to a source commit after the pre observation: that would mutate the repository and readiness head inside every quiet-window procedure. Two ordinary reservations appended in advance are also inferior because the outstanding post reservation would look unresolved unless ledger semantics were widened anyway.

Base plans should freeze calibration retry count at zero. A failed pre observation aborts before member one and closes the unused post slot; a failed post makes the physical attempt non-claim-bearing. If the lead wants one cause-removal retry, the session capability needs additional prospectively numbered slots and deterministic selection semantics before freeze—never an improvised retry.

Ideal no-failure receipt evolution from the issued sequence-76 head is three receipts per window—session capability, pre finalization, post finalization—ending at sequence 85 after all three windows. Exact sequence numbers are arm-time facts, not desk-frozen plan literals.

### F2 — The mint path needs a real v2, not another widened literal list (blocker)

The current mechanism is `scripts/floor_mint_pinsets/mint1.json` plus `scripts/mint_floor_artifact_generalized.py`. It already embodies the right principle—plans supply hard pins and the mint compares rather than derives—but it remains structurally limited:

- one plan and one artifact cell;
- `phase_energy_j.decode` only;
- `["phase","decode"]` only;
- no aggregate artifact over independently collected plans.

D-095 requires one multi-cell floor artifact whose 1.5B and 7B cells remain independently stack-scoped. D-117 adds prefill cells to both floor plans. The correct closure is therefore one four-cell artifact, not two loosely associated artifacts:

| Cell | Producer | Metric | Scientific family |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5B decode | 1.5B floor plan | `phase_energy_j.decode` | existing `df-ph-decode` |
| 1.5B prefill rider | 1.5B floor plan | `phase_energy_j.prefill` | new exact rider family |
| 7B decode | 7B floor plan | `phase_energy_j.decode` | D-085 `df-ph-decode-qwen25-7b` |
| 7B prefill rider | 7B floor plan | `phase_energy_j.prefill` | new exact rider family |

Each producer gets a component pinset; an aggregate pinset hard-checks both components and mints `d117-qwen25-phase-floor-set-v1`. Gamma consumes the two decode cells through D-095’s predeclared transport groups. It does not relabel contrast configs as floor configs.

### F3 — The D-102 successor packet is a pre-arm dependency (blocker)

A valid pre calibration can expand the observed range or approach the valid-observation limit. The issued artifact cannot absorb that live prefix today. The campaign therefore needs the following on disk and cold-gated before its first §5A arm:

- deterministic successor builder and validator;
- authenticated acceptance registry mapping acceptance ID to exact artifact SHA, derivation SHA, cutoff receipt, parent acceptance ID, and parent ledger head;
- generalized prior-set validation over a complete authenticated import-plus-live prefix;
- exact Decimal arithmetic, rounding, budget, prediction, and screen reproduction from D-079;
- a dry-run fixture that produces exact successor bytes and expected head pin;
- trigger-disposition logic that judges the range-expanding observation under the prior artifact before incorporating it into the successor;
- operator commands for pre-trigger and post-trigger branches.

I recommend deriving a successor from all content-distinct, valid, same-epoch observations through the chosen cutoff. Systematic, ordinary-invalid, aborted, or unresolved attempts remain recorded but excluded. The lead should explicitly ratify that corpus rule because D-102 establishes the successor obligation but does not fully spell out this live-prefix derivation policy.

At the pre bookend, a range expansion stops the chain before member one: close or preserve the bracket session according to the frozen state machine, commit the current ledger head, build and authenticate the successor, revalidate, then proceed. A post range expansion follows the same process after science but before the verdict. Systematic mismatch is a refusal, never something a successor can launder.

### F4 — Referenced trace missing (should-fix)

The named `docs/process_traces/2026-08-07-prefill-feasibility/SYNTHESIS.md` is absent at `94a24e5`. D-117 itself records the adopted conclusion, so this memo treats the following as governing:

- floor prefill cells ride the floor-window decode members;
- gamma remains decode-only;
- the historical 128-token prefill contrast was marginal;
- a prospectively frozen 256-token contrast remains Ed’s option.

The missing trace prevents verification of any additional numerical assumptions it may contain. In particular, this memo does not freeze a 256-token runtime or effect-size target.

### F5 — Queue terminology is superseded (should-fix)

`TASK_QUEUE.md` still carries `MET-WINDOW-C-01`, prospective “C/D” splitting, and an old `MINT-GENERALIZE-01` D-110 blocker. Those rows cannot govern this work. D-117 clause 5 owns the namespace, and the live `RUN_STATE.md` block now recognizes that ruling. The queue should be regenerated after ratification, not manually interpreted during arm readiness.

### Ranked design decisions and rejected alternatives

1. **Use a two-slot ledger session capability and exact bracket binding.** Rejected: implicit reuse of neighboring observations, mid-window Git pin commits, or pre-reserving ordinary unresolved observations.

2. **Mint one four-cell floor artifact through pinset v2.** Rejected: two unrelated floor artifacts, summing arm floors, or weakening D-095’s independently stack-scoped maximum.

3. **Freeze zero calibration retries in the base plans.** Rejected: unbounded cause-removal retries and post hoc choice among observations. A retry-enabled variant requires a different capability state machine before freeze.

4. **Make prefill a metric rider over the exact decode members.** Rejected: copying the old dedicated 4096-prompt/64-output prefill workload, because that would add members and estimate a different condition. Post hoc extraction without a pre-registered cell is also insufficient.

5. **Treat the 256-token contrast as a fourth window plan.** Rejected: appending it to gamma later, which would change gamma’s plan SHA, member universe, order, multiplicity, runtime, and verdict basis.

6. **Use semantic immutable identifiers without dates or letters.** Rejected: `Window D`, C/D, and date-derived identities. Attempt dates belong in custody metadata, not scientific identity.

7. **Use a two-stage pin freeze.** Desk time freezes every knowable identifier, schema, member list, hash, and rule. Six-decimal operative values freeze only after governed collection and extraction. Rejected: placeholder literals presented as valid pins or any mint-time derivation.

### Proven template lineage

The templates are scientific and structural sources, not claim evidence.

| Plan | Files treated as the proven template | What is reused |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5B floor | `configs/campaigns/p2_015_floors/calibration_plan.json`; its SHA sidecar and generator; `02_phase_absolute/p2015-df-ph-decode-abs-r01.json` through `r10.json`; `05_phase_decode_abba/`’s forty decode configs and manifest; root `order_manifest.json`; `configs/floor_mint/a10_extraction_spec.json`; `configs/floor_mint/window_c_extraction_spec.json` | Exact Qwen2.5-1.5B stack identity, 10 absolute members, ten fixed A/B/B/A null blocks, runtime/config conventions, extraction shape |
| 7B floor | Entire `configs/campaigns/qwen25_7b_decode_floor_v1/`, including plan, SHA, generator, root/stage manifests, ten absolute configs, and two twenty-member ABBA halves | Ratified D-085 condition family, Qwen2.5-7B model identity, 10+40 design, midpoint split |
| Decode contrast | Entire `configs/campaigns/splitwise_decode_v1/`, particularly the plan, generator, forty configs, root/stage manifests, condition families, and `analysis_manifest_v3.json` | A=1.5B, B=7B, ten ABBA blocks, B−A orientation, v3 estimator and cross-stack floor rule |
| Operational references | `configs/campaigns/neg8_reference_corpus/` and the existing start/mid/end reference manifests | Twelve-member same-window NEG8 binding plus 3/1/3 references |

The old `02_phase_absolute/order_manifest.json` contains thirty interleaved decode, prefill, and short-prefill configs. It must not be copied as the new absolute manifest. Only its ten decode configs are the alpha source; the new ten-entry manifest is regenerated and independently hashed.

Historical results are diagnostic inputs only. No old evidence-root ID, calibration bracket, member output, or operative floor literal enters a prospective claim basis.

### Immutable identifier proposal

| Placeholder | Frozen plan ID | Evidence-root ID | Physical root |
|---|---|---|---|
| W-alpha | `plan-d117-floor-qwen25-1p5b-decode-p128-prefill-rider-v1` | `evidence-d117-floor-qwen25-1p5b-v1` | `runs_d117_floor_qwen25_1p5b_v1` |
| W-beta | `plan-d117-floor-qwen25-7b-decode-p128-prefill-rider-v1` | `evidence-d117-floor-qwen25-7b-v1` | `runs_d117_floor_qwen25_7b_v1` |
| W-gamma | `plan-d117-contrast-qwen25-1p5b-vs-7b-decode-v1` | `evidence-d117-contrast-qwen25-1p5b-vs-7b-v1` | `runs_d117_contrast_qwen25_1p5b_vs_7b_v1` |

Each also gets a separately named bound root ending in `_bound`. Failed physical attempts receive custody attempt suffixes outside the scientific ID; the clean evidence root is never silently reused.

### Common order-manifest contract

Every root manifest should bind:

- plan ID, exact plan SHA, generator SHA, and model/runtime revisions;
- ordered stage records with exact stage-manifest ID, SHA, expected member count, predecessor, and successor;
- exact relative config paths and config SHAs—no globs or directory discovery;
- ordinal, member ID, ABBA block and slot where applicable;
- fixed reference and NEG8 manifests;
- the prefill rider mapping for floor members;
- frozen attempt policy, including zero calibration retries and no outcome-driven top-ups;
- evidence-root ID and expected fresh physical path;
- hashes of condition families, extraction spec, and analysis manifest;
- arm-time attachment slots for the readiness record, session capability, and actual receipt identifiers without modifying frozen plan bytes.

An ABBA stage manifest records each block as `A1,B1,B2,A2`. Splitting blocks 1–5 and 6–10 around the midpoint reference does not reset block numbering.

### Per-window plans

#### Alpha — 1.5B decode floor plus prefill rider

| Stage | Members | Order |
|---|---:|---|
| Pre calibration | 1 live observation | Finalize reserved `pre` slot before science |
| Same-window bound corpus | 12 | Frozen NEG8 order, then bound evaluation |
| Start references | 3 | Frozen triplet |
| Absolute floor | 10 | `abs-r01` through `abs-r10` |
| Null half 1 | 20 | ABBA blocks 1–5 |
| Midpoint reference | 1 | Frozen midpoint |
| Null half 2 | 20 | ABBA blocks 6–10 |
| End references | 3 | Frozen triplet |
| Post calibration | 1 live observation | Finalize reserved `post` slot |
| Closeout | 0 science members | Terminal head pin, bracket binding, verdict, dual-root backup |

Science count is 50; operational captures are 12 bound, 7 references, and 2 calibrations. The prefill rider adds no member and no runtime.

The rider is a new condition family over the same 128-prompt/512-output decode bundles. It must pre-register `phase_energy_j.prefill`, phase precheck `["phase","prefill"]`, exact tokenizer/model/config identity, the same ten absolute members and forty null members, its estimator, n=10 block basis, and both absolute and comparative floor rules. It is not the old dedicated prefill condition.

The extraction spec contains four cells: decode absolute, decode comparative, prefill absolute, and prefill comparative. It names 100 cell-member references but exactly 50 unique bundles. Each cell supplies an exact member list, config hash list, expected n, condition-family hash, metric key, phase precheck, order-manifest pin, calibration basis, and evidence-root ID. Missing prefill phases, fallback values, or member discovery outside the list are fatal.

#### Beta — 7B decode floor plus prefill rider

The schedule is identical to alpha: pre calibration; 12 NEG8; start 3; absolute 10; ABBA blocks 1–5; midpoint 1; blocks 6–10; end 3; post calibration.

The decode condition remains D-085’s `df-ph-decode-qwen25-7b`; the fresh plan does not rename settled scientific semantics. The new prefill-rider family pins `phase_energy_j.prefill` over the exact 7B decode members and stack revision.

Its extraction contract is the same four-cell/50-unique-bundle shape as alpha. Old 7B values—absolute 6.294380… J and comparative 13.998036… J—are budget/design diagnostics only and are not pre-registered pins.

#### Gamma — 1.5B-versus-7B decode contrast

| Stage | Members | Order |
|---|---:|---|
| Pre calibration | 1 live observation | Finalize `pre` slot |
| Same-window bound corpus | 12 | Frozen NEG8 order, then bound evaluation |
| Start references | 3 | Frozen triplet |
| Contrast half 1 | 20 | ABBA blocks 1–5 |
| Midpoint reference | 1 | Frozen midpoint |
| Contrast half 2 | 20 | ABBA blocks 6–10 |
| End references | 3 | Frozen triplet |
| Post calibration | 1 live observation | Finalize `post` slot |
| Closeout | 0 science members | Pin, binding, verdict, backup, then analysis |

The frozen manifest remains decode-only:

- A is the exact 1.5B stack; B is the exact 7B stack.
- Metric is exactly `phase_energy_j.decode`.
- Estimand orientation is B−A.
- Design is ten A/B/B/A blocks, n=10 block estimates.
- Estimator is `abba_block_arm_mean_difference_t_v1`.
- Test is two-sided at family alpha 0.05, with the positive direction stated as the scientific hypothesis rather than used to change the test.
- `equivalence_margin` and `mde` remain null unless prospectively ruled otherwise.
- Floor rule remains `cross_stack_armwise_max.v1`: independently resolve the 1.5B and 7B decode cells and take their maximum, never their sum.
- Claim-side anchor bounds remain separate from the detection-floor operation.
- The finalized analysis basis pins the exact forty member paths, config hashes, stack identities, floor artifact bytes, calibration binding, and evidence root.

### Runtime evidence and budgets

Historical evidence in `docs/phase_2/splitwise_decode_campaign.md` §4 supplies:

- 1.5B decode member: 92.7 s, measured n=40;
- 1.5B reference member: 90.5 s, measured n=7;
- 7B decode member: approximately 97 s from the measured/probed anchor;
- 1.5B/7B mixed ABBA half: about 31.6 min raw member time.

The stage allowances incorporate the configured 30-second idle, warmup/teardown, stage arm overhead, and cooldown conventions. The pre-calibration allowance includes the required 180-second post-admin settle. The separate ten-minute untouched quiet-idle gate is added before applying the 20% margin.

| Component, minutes | Alpha | Beta | Gamma |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Pre calibration bracket | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| 12 NEG8 bound members | 22 | 22 | 22 |
| Bound evaluation | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Start 3 references | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| Absolute 10 | 19 | 20 | — |
| ABBA blocks 1–5 | 34 | 36 | 35 |
| Midpoint reference | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| ABBA blocks 6–10 | 34 | 36 | 35 |
| End 3 references | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| Post calibration bracket | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| Campaign subtotal | 147 | 152 | 130 |
| Untouched pre-arm idle | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Base occupancy | 157 | 162 | 140 |
| With 20% failure margin | **188.4** | **194.4** | **168.0** |
| Hours | **3.14 h** | **3.24 h** | **2.80 h** |
| 2–4 h envelope | Pass | Pass | Pass |

The margin is time headroom, not authority to add members, replace a cap-hit observation, or top up an unfavorable result. The fixed manifest and frozen failure policy decide scientific validity.

### §5A operator bookends

Before each window:

1. Verify the reviewed plan/readiness record, fresh empty roots, model artifacts, charger/AC state, power policy, OS/tool identity, empty waiver set, and current acceptance artifact.
2. Verify the physical ledger head equals the authenticated committed pin.
3. Correct the clock against the trusted source, record the correction and `usingnetworktime` state, turn network time off, and settle for at least 180 seconds.
4. Establish zero-agent/zero-output-streaming conditions and complete ten untouched minutes of daemon idle.
5. Append the exact two-slot bracket session capability.
6. Capture and finalize the pre observation; run the acceptance and D-102 trigger probe.
7. Only after every gate is green, emit the one-line arm message and walk away.

At the closing bookend:

1. Capture the post observation before changing power, network-time, or workload state.
2. Finalize the post slot or write the governed failure/abort closure.
3. Commit and authenticate the terminal ledger head.
4. Emit the exact bracket binding and whole-window verdict from one immutable ledger snapshot.
5. Back up evidence and bound roots with verified return code and hashes.
6. Restore network time and record the restoration only after measurement completion and custody closeout.

### Prefill floor claim eligibility

A rider is claim-eligible only if desk freeze already binds:

- exact metric and phase path;
- exact workload parameters, model/tokenizer revision, seeds, quantization, runtime, sampling, and telemetry mode;
- absolute and comparative member lists and order manifests;
- exact condition-family ID and hash;
- n and estimator;
- calibration cell, acceptance artifact role, and D-110 allowance rule;
- extraction failure behavior;
- allowed consumer families.

For each metric, the operative floor is the maximum of independently evaluated absolute and comparative components. Apply D-110 once as `A_s = max(observed_drift, 0.010818)`. Never sum components and never borrow a decode floor for prefill.

### Two-stage mint freeze

**Desk-frozen pin requirements**

For each floor plan, freeze:

- plan ID, declared SHA, sidecar SHA, and actual artifact SHA;
- evidence-root ID;
- four intended cell roles across the two plans;
- condition-family IDs/hashes;
- metric and phase-precheck paths;
- absolute and comparative order-manifest IDs/hashes;
- extraction-spec SHA and exact members;
- expected counts;
- model/runtime/config hashes;
- calibration acceptance artifact ID/SHA/derivation rule;
- D-110 never-zero allowance rule;
- aggregate artifact ID and transport allowlists.

These live in a non-mintable `pin_requirements.v2` artifact. Unresolved values must be structurally absent or explicitly marked unresolved; the file cannot satisfy the final pinset schema.

**Postcollection-frozen pins**

After passed verdicts and governed extraction, freeze separately for each of the four cells:

- absolute and comparative evaluation-basis SHA/count;
- exact accepted pre/post receipt and content digests;
- bracket-binding SHA and terminal ledger head;
- observed drift and applied allowance;
- extraction-report SHA;
- absolute, comparative, and operative values;
- the operative literal formatted independently as exactly six decimals using the repository’s `.6f` convention.

The lead independently recomputes each six-decimal literal from primary extraction bytes. The mint only compares supplied literals and hashes; it does not calculate them. The old `7.377086` literal is never reused.

Gamma has no producer mint. Its consumer pinset instead binds the exact combined floor artifact bytes, the two decode-cell IDs, its plan/order/analysis manifests, and its finalized evaluation basis.

### Synthetic three-window live-ledger regression

The fixture begins with the exact issued-ledger semantics: 76 receipts, including 38 historical import observations—30 valid, 2 systematic, 6 ordinary-invalid. Candidate discovery must exclude every import-marked observation.

The no-failure live extension adds three bracket capabilities and six finalized live observations. From one immutable final snapshot, the regression must prove:

- exactly six live candidates and zero imported candidates;
- alpha, beta, and gamma each bind only their own pre/post pair;
- all six are same-epoch, causal, fresh, within protocol and T1 limits;
- no neighboring endpoint can substitute for a bound endpoint;
- all three verdicts use the same complete candidate universe;
- the ideal terminal sequence is 85 under the proposed three-receipt session model;
- the D-110 never-zero allowance remains active.

Required refusal vectors:

- import-marker removal, import leakage, or candidate-discovery regression;
- missing, duplicate, reordered, or conflicting session/finalization receipts;
- open or abandoned session without a governed closure;
- physical-head/pin mismatch, rollback, fork, or uncommitted terminal head;
- omitted, added, duplicated, off-ledger, or content-substituted observations;
- missing, tampered, swapped, or cross-window bracket binding;
- noncausal endpoint, stale endpoint, T1 failure, protocol failure, or epoch mismatch;
- systematic classification;
- one range-expanding live observation requiring a successor;
- the observation-count boundary reaching the D-102 limit;
- a successor whose prior set omits or changes an authenticated prefix.

### Optional 256-token prefill contrast

Clean attachment inside frozen gamma is impossible. Adding the arm changes the workload, metric family, members, order, runtime, multiplicity, plan digest, evidence root, and verdict basis.

If Ed adopts it, create a fourth independently frozen, independently calibrated plan and evidence root. It may attach later only in a higher-level synthesis/claim packet that references gamma and the new prefill result as sibling artifacts. Gamma’s bytes remain unchanged.

The floor riders here use the prefill phase of the 128-prompt decode workload. They do not automatically transport to a prospectively defined 256-token contrast. The fourth plan needs either exact matching prefill floor cells or a separately predeclared and justified transport rule. No placeholder members or plan ID should be added to gamma now.

### Freeze order and lead gates

1. **Ruling gate:** lead accepts the session-capability semantics, zero-retry policy, successor corpus rule, four-cell artifact shape, and fourth-window treatment.
2. **Toolchain gate:** ledger session/binding, successor builder, pinset v2, multi-cell mint, prefill metric support, and three-window regression all land and pass focused plus canonical suites.
3. **Desk freeze gate:** generate all three campaign packs; freeze identifiers, model revisions, configs, manifests, condition families, extraction/analysis specs, budgets, failure policy, and hashes. Six-decimal values do not yet exist.
4. **Per-window arm gate:** attach current clean head, acceptance artifact, physical/committed ledger equality, fresh roots, exact environment preflight, empty waivers, §5A evidence, and bracket-session identifiers.
5. **Pre-science trigger gate:** finalize the pre observation and either accept it, issue a governed successor, or abort before member one.
6. **Post-window gate:** finalize post, commit terminal head, issue bracket binding, verdict, and verified backup.
7. **Floor mint gate:** after alpha and beta pass, run governed four-cell extraction, independently freeze literals, mint the combined artifact, and require `validate_floor_artifact` to return no findings.
8. **Gamma claim gate:** pass the whole-window verdict, finalize the v3 basis, run D-093 root scanning, resolve both decode arm floors from exact combined-artifact bytes, and apply the armwise maximum.

Every unit should run its focused tests and `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`. Shared files make U1→U2 sequential; U1 and U3 can proceed independently. U5 and U6 can proceed independently after U3 freezes the vocabulary. U7 waits for final floor-cell and transport identifiers. U10 is deliberately absent from the desk freeze.

### What the lead should double-check

- Recover the missing prefill-feasibility trace and compare its exact 256-token assumptions with this fourth-window conclusion.
- Ratify the two-slot ledger capability against D-109/D-116, especially whether an open post slot may exist during the pre-science successor probe.
- Decide explicitly between zero calibration retries and a prospectively numbered retry-capability variant.
- Ratify the D-102 successor corpus rule: all content-distinct valid same-epoch observations through the cutoff.
- Confirm that D-085’s 7B decode family ID is preserved and contrast transport uses allowlists rather than relabeling configs.
- Confirm pinset v2 supports multiple producer plans while preserving byte-for-byte v1 behavior.
- Verify the 20% allowance does not become permission for member replacement or result-driven top-up.
- Recheck full model revisions, local artifact hashes, runtime version, charger identity, and post-move environment at each arm.
- Independently calculate all four `.6f` operative literals from primary extraction bytes.
- Verify every one of the fifty floor bundles actually contains the registered prefill phase; a missing phase must fail extraction.
- Ensure gamma takes the maximum of the two decode arm floors, never their sum, and retains separate claim-side anchor bounds.
- Ensure the 128-prompt prefill riders are not presented as a floor for a later 256-token contrast without exact transport evidence.
- Regenerate the active queue from the state kernel so superseded C/D and D-110 gates cannot be mistaken for arm authority.
- Freeze against the final reviewed repository head; this consult began at `dbb9685` and ended cleanly at concurrently advanced `94a24e5`.

## Residual risk

No live timings, calibration observations, successor generation, or mint replay were performed. Runtime estimates therefore inherit historical-machine variance; the 20% margin is the current mitigation.

The absent feasibility synthesis limits review of the optional 256-token arm. Its attachment architecture is sound, but its member count, runtime, estimand, and floor transport remain intentionally unfrozen.
