## Findings

### F1 — Finish the claim-bearing metrology spine before expanding

The instrument and its evidence machinery are unusually mature, but the paper still lacks a complete claim-bearing characterization result. The 1.5B/7B contrast passed collection gates and is a compelling preliminary demonstration, yet D-110 prevents formal use until the issuance/remint chain completes. D-113 then requires fresh Window C collection—split into D if necessary—without importing any retired Window B member. See [D-113](/Users/edr/code/JouleWise/docs/decision_log.md:7240) and the [current paper outline](/Users/edr/code/JouleWise/docs/run_reports/2026-07-30-paper-outline-v1.md:1).

That is the critical path. A broad paper with incomplete C1–C6 evidence will look less serious than a narrower paper that cleanly demonstrates linearity, null response, empirical floor behavior, additivity, drift/settling, and between-session stability.

D-113’s rigor-first posture forbids:

- Salvaging failed A/B data into replacement claim cells.
- Excluding an inconvenient member after seeing results.
- Compressing an oversized campaign into one night.
- Weakening calibration, whole-window, clock, or custody gates for schedule reasons.
- Adding process or repetitions without a named validity threat or material claim benefit.

It explicitly permits—and often prefers—smaller independent windows, narrower claims, and cutting an expansion.

### F2 — Exact D-041 ruling and the real mechanism fence

D-041 is titled “Benchmark interop — frozen-subset imports + marker-shim energy layer.” It fences:

- External benchmark imports to hash-frozen subsets with identity, licensing, and contamination records.
- Export to a marker-emitting shim where the external harness owns prompts, generation semantics, and accuracy; JouleWise owns capture, bundle assembly, marker validation, and energy reduction.
- Joined reporting to observed energy beside the external metric artifact—never JouleWise accuracy, pass@k-per-joule, leaderboard standing, or intelligence-per-joule.
- Implementation to after 2M and P2-010a, unless D-034 is explicitly reopened.
- Interop expansion to be cut before core Mac characterization under schedule pressure.

Thus, “unfencing D-041” would require completing 2M and P2-010a—or an explicit decision reopening D-034/D-041 sequencing—then passing P2-022’s marker feasibility spike and writing an analysis-plan row before any L2 claim. It still would not authorize mechanism attribution.

The KDA/speculative-decode/MTP/MoE program is instead governed by D-070/D-075 and the AXI contracts:

- Post-core/floor sequencing.
- L2 ceiling for named studies unless Q4’s independent L3 machinery applies.
- Direct observability rather than inference from configuration.
- Output/quality-equivalence controls.
- Named forbidden generalizations.

The current feasibility facts matter:

- External-draft speculative generation exists, but pinned `mlx-lm` lacks actual proposal counts and decode-step emission boundaries.
- Native MTP is unsupported: the pinned runtime does not execute the heads.
- KDA/hybrid comparisons currently involve cross-model confounding and unverified long-context execution.
- MoE mechanism language requires auditable routing evidence; otherwise the claim must remain a named-model energy comparison, not routing attribution.
- No tracked repository document uses “KDA” as a governed project axis; it appears in the nonbinding mechanism-literature sweep, not D-041.

### Ranked roadmap

Planning estimates below assume the current 2–4-hour claim-window protocol, at least 20% failure margin, and physical Ed preparation through §5A.

| Rank | Expansion | Why it impresses reviewers | Estimated effort and Ed-present sessions | Dependencies and principal risk | Decision required |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Complete C1–C7 cleanly: remint, fresh C/D, and stability** | Converts the strongest idea—the instrument and its refusal behavior—into actual evidence. This is the difference between an elaborate methodology and a metrology paper. | **3–6 weeks after desk gates; 2 mandatory nights plus 1 contingency/short stability session.** | D-079 issued artifact; D-110 remint; reviewed frozen-plan record; fresh §5A; C/D split if scope cannot fit. Risk: another environmental or clock refusal. | Reserve the core nights now and prohibit breadth work from consuming them. |
| **2** | **External wall-meter validation of totals, C8** | Directly addresses the obvious reviewer question: “Does `powermetrics` agree with physical input power?” It materially upgrades absolute-scale credibility. | **4–8 weeks; 1 pilot plus 1 confirmatory session.** The confirmatory run may share a later frozen campaign only after the importer and protocol pass independently. | Professional AC analyzer, safe inline fixture, synchronized export, fixed ranges, load-specific uncertainty, battery charge neutralization, held-out regression. It validates totals only—not phase allocation. | D-092 already decided “yes”; Ed/advisor must now authorize purchase/loan, budget, and an evidence-by date. |
| **3** | **Artifact-evaluation-quality release** | Hash-bound raw-to-figure reproducibility is a genuine differentiator and unusually well aligned with JouleWise’s thesis. Reviewers can verify refusals and re-derive results rather than trust screenshots. | **4–6 weeks; 0 measurement nights.** | Sanitized raw-bundle subset, one-command validation/reduction/figure path, locked environment, quick/full tracks, immutable archive/DOI, clear hardware-free replay. Risk: privacy, dataset size, and Mac-only collection requirements. | Decide whether the target is merely open source or formal ICPE-style artifact evaluation, and which evidence may be public. |
| **4** | **Designed workload-shape matrix with held-out prediction—Q4/L3** | A predictive fixed-plus-marginal model validated on held-out cells is substantially more serious than “we ran more prompts.” It can earn L3 rather than another collection of L1/L2 points. | **6–10 weeks; approximately 2–3 nights.** | P2-006 baseline sizing, AP-1, 4×3 grid, predeclared holdouts, residual/sensitivity analysis, floor audit. Risk: the simple model may fail its holdouts—which must be reported honestly. | Fund the full designed matrix or omit the predictive claim; do not replace it with opportunistic workload breadth. |
| **5** | **Quality-gated BF16/Q8/Q4 quantization ladder** | A clean same-family ladder with error bars and output-divergence reporting can adjudicate the reported q4-vs-q8 anomaly. Strong workshop demonstration; moderate novelty. | **4–8 weeks; 1–2 nights.** Quality screening can run outside quiet windows. | One frozen source revision, reproducible conversions, 256-item quality gate, 32-item energy subset, stack-specific floors. Risk: quality may not be equivalent or quantization may alter cadence beyond existing calibration support. | Choose the model family before conversion; accept a quality/energy trade-off result if equivalence fails. |
| **6** | **Second-unit replication after multi-day same-unit stability** | This is the clearest path beyond single-machine claims and toward L4. It demonstrates that the artifact and calibration method transfer, not merely that one laptop is stable. | **4–8 weeks once access exists; 2 sessions on the second unit, 0–2 Ed-present depending on operator.** | A second comparable Apple unit, frozen stack or explicitly modeled version difference, independent calibration and artifact execution. Risk: OS/hardware drift may make it replication-aware rather than directly pooled. | Secure a second unit/collaborator or explicitly retain the single-unit ceiling. |
| **7** | **One mechanism-level study, conditional on a hard feasibility gate** | **Highest scientific ceiling.** A controlled batch-1 speculative-decode or MTP energy result could be genuinely novel; KDA/context slope or MoE routing is also interesting if attribution is identifiable. | **2–3-week desk feasibility gate; if passed, another 6–12 weeks and roughly 2 nights.** | New/forked runtime instrumentation, direct proposal/acceptance events, output identity/equivalence, mechanism-specific AP and floors. MTP currently cannot execute; KDA is confounded; MoE routing visibility is uncertain. | Pick exactly one mechanism and a kill date. Recommended first choice: external-draft speculative decode, because it offers the cleanest same-target on/off contrast if observability can be added. |
| **8** | **Split inference: synthetic transfer plus one offline split pairing** | Demonstrates the instrument under two boundaries, a transfer interval, and cross-device clocks. A complete per-stage bundle is impressive even without a crossover. | **2–4 months; roughly 3–5 two-device measurement sessions.** Live split adds more and should remain stretch. | Schema v0.2, remaining replay verdicts, two-node telemetry, clock bounds, transfer bench, 3080 Ti window, two links, wall/host boundary or lower-bound wording. Risk is high and the engineering can dominate the paper. | Commit only to synthetic transfer plus offline replay; authorize live split separately after offline results. |
| **9** | **Additional model families, generic workloads, Jetsons** | Useful corroboration, but mostly incremental unless each addition tests a predeclared hypothesis or provides independent replication. More rows do not overcome the single-unit or boundary limitations. | **3–8 weeks and 1–2 nights per coherent axis/device.** | New model lineage, adapter, quality and floor cells; Jetson remains optional and remote pins are provisional. | Add only a model or device that changes the claim—not merely the size of a results table. |

For the wall-meter path, the right class is a calibrated bench AC power analyzer, not an inexpensive consumer plug. A concrete baseline is the Yokogawa WT310E: its manufacturer lists 10 readings/s, USB export, 0.1%-of-reading plus 0.05%-of-range basic accuracy, high crest-factor capability, and a **$2,935 base US price** before calibration/fixture costs. Actual suitability still depends on calculating uncertainty at the Mac’s observed load and using a safe inline fixture. Borrowing an in-calibration unit from an engineering lab is preferable to spending several thousand dollars.

### Venue ambition

| Tier | What the current/expanded project can support | What should be present |
|---|---|---|
| **CSCSU** | After remint and clean C/D, this should be a strong undergraduate-conference submission. The latest published rules allow technical papers and extensive experimentation, with **5 pages including references**. [CSCSU 2026 guidance](https://cscsu-conference.github.io/) | C1–C6 core, one demonstration, crisp limitations, compact artifact pointer. Wall validation and split are not necessary. |
| **EuroMLSys/HotCarbon workshop** | The natural near-term research target. EuroMLSys’s latest call uses 6 pages excluding references; HotCarbon uses 5 pages excluding references and no appendix. [EuroMLSys](https://euromlsys.eu/), [HotCarbon CFP](https://hotcarbon.org/cfp) | Clean metrology core, model contrast, wall validation if available, and polished artifact. EuroMLSys is the better technical-method fit; HotCarbon needs a stronger sustainability-metrics argument. |
| **ICPE Emerging/WIP** | Appropriate if the core is strong but external validation, replication, or the broader predictive evaluation remains incomplete. The 2026 track used a 6-page format. [ICPE Emerging Research](https://icpe2026.spec.org/tracks-and-submissions/emerging-research-track/) | Validated core, transparent open gaps, early artifact, and a credible expansion plan. |
| **ICPE full research track** | Plausible over months, but not yet supported by the current evidence. ICPE 2027 lists research and artifact tracks but their details and dates remain TBA. The 2026 research track used 10 pages and judged novelty, technical quality, and scientific soundness; 2026’s reported full-paper acceptance rate was 28%. [ICPE 2027](https://icpe2027.spec.org/tracks-and-submissions/research-paper-track/), [2026 research criteria](https://icpe2026.spec.org/tracks-and-submissions/research-paper-track/), [acceptance history](https://icpe.spec.org/past-conferences/) | C1–C8, cross-day stability, artifact-ready release, and at least one deeper contribution: held-out Q4 prediction, second-unit replication, or a successful mechanism study. Split is not required. |

ICPE’s artifact track is especially aligned: it asks for documented, consistent, complete, exercisable artifacts, permanent archival availability, and practical setup/reproduction instructions. [ICPE artifact-evaluation criteria](https://icpe2026.spec.org/tracks-and-submissions/artifact-evaluation-track/).

### Critical path to the strongest defensible version

1. **Now:** finish D-079 issuance and the D-110 remint chain; integrate or disposition the draft branch; set actual calendar and venue evidence-by dates.
2. **In parallel:** borrow/order the wall analyzer and build its importer, synchronization, and held-out validation protocol without assuming it will arrive in time.
3. **First hardware block:** freeze and collect Window C, then D if the complete replacement cannot fit with the required margin. Add a third short day/session only if needed for the stated stability claim.
4. **Immediately after each passing window:** produce the governed artifacts, deterministic figures, claim-index entries, and experimental prose. Do not wait for all expansions before writing.
5. **Artifact block:** publish a sanitized, hash-bound raw-to-figure package with a fast hardware-free reproduction path and archival DOI.
6. **Second hardware block:** run external wall validation.
7. **Choose one expansion:** Q4 held-out prediction for the strongest ICPE case; quantization for the safest workshop enhancement; or mechanism work only if its short feasibility gate passes.
8. **Only then consider split inference.** Start it only if the 3080 Ti window is dated and the transfer/offline-replay path is rehearsed before hardware access.
9. **Freeze the dataset early:** reserve at least six weeks before submission for figures, claims audit, paper compression, artifact dry runs, and advisor review.

The strongest realistic paper is therefore: **C1–C8 metrology + the already-collected 1.5B/7B demonstration + one designed extension + an independently usable artifact.** That is more coherent and defensible than a larger model/device matrix or an unfinished split system.

### F3 — Five decisions Ed/advisor must make

1. **Venue and publication sequence.** Choose CSCSU-only, workshop-first, or ICPE-full ambition, and verify whether a workshop publication may later be extended for ICPE. Build a 10-page master manuscript even if the first submission is shorter.

2. **Physical measurement budget.** Recommended commitment: **5–7 Ed-present sessions**—C, D, one contingency/stability repeat, wall pilot/confirmation, and one extension. An ICPE-full attempt with Q4 and second-unit work likely needs **8–10 total sessions** across operators.

3. **Meter execution.** D-092 has already answered “yes.” The remaining decision is: borrow versus buy, approximately $3,000-class budget, calibration/fixture responsibility, and a cutoff date after which C8 is cleanly removed.

4. **Mechanism ambition.** Do not ask simply “unfence D-041.” Decide whether to retain D-070’s all-five-axis commitment or narrow it to one paper-worthy study. Recommended rule: two-to-three-week feasibility gate for speculative-decode observability; if it fails, return immediately to Q4/quantization.

5. **External hardware priority.** Decide whether scarce coordination goes to a second Apple unit, the 3080 Ti split study, or Jetsons. Recommendation: second-unit replication first, 3080 Ti second, Jetsons last.

### F4 — Draft-state correction

The methods draft was inspected from `impl/paper-draft-v1` at commit `af0b7195`; it is one commit ahead of and one commit behind `main`. It already reflects the right rigor: result placeholders remain pending remint, all characterization rows are pending Window C, and the split section is framed as future demonstration work. It should be integrated deliberately so the paper itself becomes the continuously updated claim-state surface.

## Residual risk

- The mechanism-literature sweep is explicitly desk research, not governed project evidence. Any “first measured” novelty claim needs a fresh literature search immediately before submission.
- Venue formats and deadlines cited above are current published 2026 rules or incomplete 2027 pages; 2027 calls may change.
- Measurement-night estimates are planning ranges, not validated campaign runtimes.
- Wall validation cannot establish phase attribution, and one external meter does not create cross-device generality.
- Even an excellent single-Mac study remains stack-specific under the claims ladder unless second-unit or cross-lab replication lands.
