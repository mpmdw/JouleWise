PAPER-PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT SESSION (one of a 20-direction parallel fan-out).

You are developing ONE candidate research-paper direction for the JouleWise project
into a full, reviewable proposal. Work read-mostly; do NOT create or modify any files —
your final message IS the deliverable. You may read any repo file.

== PROJECT BRIEF (state as of 2026-08-07) ==
JouleWise is Ed's undergraduate CS capstone: treating Apple's `powermetrics` software
power counter as a calibrated scientific instrument for phase-resolved (prefill vs
decode), single-request LLM inference energy on one named M3 Max stack (MLX, Qwen2.5
family, 4-bit). Core findings/machinery to date: in-window bracketed pulse-train
calibration of timing attribution; the instrument is ATTRIBUTION-LIMITED (~1 J per
phase member from ~30 ms edge uncertainty × ~33 W swings; repetition cannot average it
away), not noise-limited; detection floors composed from repeatability + worst-case
attribution + measured never-zero drift, published labelled; TWO separate claim gates
(floor clearance; interval-supported direction) with a practical ~5 J sizing bar for
phase contrasts; fail-closed collection protocol (pre-registration, admission gates,
ABBA counterbalancing, hash-bound custody chains, refusal log as evidence). MVP paper
draft is complete-in-structure (docs/paper/draft-v1.md) with demonstration values
pending. The claim path (decision D-117, adopted today): THREE fresh prospective quiet
windows — 1.5B decode floor, 7B decode floor, 1.5B-vs-7B decode contrast — each
live-bracketed under an issued calibration-acceptance regime; prefill floor cells ride
the floor windows; a 256-token prefill contrast arm is an open option (128-token
prefill contrast is MARGINAL vs the bar — custodied desk check).
Steps from here: 3 quiet-mac nights (operator bookends only) + desk work (window plans,
mint pinsets, extraction specs, regression) → mint floors → populate the paper →
capstone submission; then an ICPE-class version.

== CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS ==
- Advisor: Suzanne Rivoire (JouleSort co-author) — sets a real metrology bar; plain
  language required in reader-facing text.
- Venue ladder: capstone (CSCSU-class) → ICPE full research track is the realistic
  ambitious target; top-tier only if a mechanism/split research bet lands.
- Hardware: M3 Max MacBook Pro 128 GB (the instrumented unit); an RTX 3080 Ti desktop
  rig; optional Jetsons; a Yokogawa WT310E wall meter is NOT owned but may be BORROWED
  from the advisor's lab (claim C8 ratified the wall-meter axis as future work).
- Measurement economics: each claim window is a 2-4 h quiet night with operator
  bookends; effects must clear the two gates (~5 J practical sizing for phase
  contrasts on this stack; workload LENGTH is the free lever since attribution error
  is ~duration-independent).
- Ed's ORIGINAL research goals (pre-metrology-pivot, still wanted long-term):
  mechanism-level energy profiling as a third metrics axis alongside quality+latency —
  speculative decoding, multi-token prediction (MTP), mixture-of-experts (MoE)
  routing, KV/attention variants (e.g. KDA), and SPLIT/disaggregated inference across
  consumer devices; a modular harness where every experiment axis (model, inference
  technique, workload, size) is swappable; energy-honest leaderboard/reporting
  critique. Repo context worth reading: docs/strategy/2026-08-06-impressiveness-roadmap.md,
  docs/research_question_registry.md, docs/research_question_bank.md,
  docs/paper/draft-v1.md (esp. §§3-5), CLAIMS_STATUS.md, docs/decision_log.md (D-117,
  at end of file).

== YOUR DELIVERABLE (final message, markdown, ~600-1200 words) ==
1. TITLE + one-sentence thesis.
2. PROJECT-BRIEF-AND-STEPS paragraph: half a page restating the current project state
   and the concrete steps from today to THIS paper (audience: Ed deciding what to
   fund with nights/desk time).
3. CONTRIBUTIONS (3-5, numbered, each falsifiable).
4. EXPERIMENT PLAN sized against the instrument: cells, contrasts, expected effect
   magnitudes vs the ~5 J sizing bar (estimate from public knowledge + repo
   diagnostics you can find; state which effects might NOT clear and what the refusal
   would mean), number of quiet windows needed, desk-work list, any new harness
   capability required (and whether it violates the frozen single-request boundary).
5. HARDWARE/INSTRUMENT needs (owned / borrowed / new; wall-meter dependency yes/no).
6. VENUE fit + why (capstone chapter? ICPE? workshop?), and how it BUILDS ON the MVP
   paper (shared method sections, what's new).
7. RISKS + KILL CRITERIA (what desk evidence would kill it before spending a night).
8. RELATION TO ED'S ORIGINAL GOALS: which original axis it serves, or state plainly
   that it does not.
Be concrete and quantitative wherever possible; flag every number you are unsure of.

== HARD CONSTRAINT (Ed, binding) ==
Every proposal MUST turn the EXISTING material into a solid scientific paper: the
calibrated instrument and its custody/fail-closed protocol machinery, the
attribution-limited finding, the banked diagnostics, the data the three D-117 windows
will produce (decode floors for 1.5B and 7B, prefill floor riders, the decode
contrast), and modest extensions collectible on the owned hardware under the SAME
instrument discipline. Do NOT propose work that abandons the instrument or needs
apparatus/data without a concrete path (the borrowed WT310E wall meter is allowed
where justified as an extension of existing material). If your assigned direction
cannot honestly be built from existing material, SAY SO PLAINLY and shrink it to the
version that can — a smaller honest paper beats an unmoored ambitious one.
