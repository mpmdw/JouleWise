# Research Question Registry

Purpose: this is the canonical live index for JouleWise research questions,
capability claims, application ideas, and methodology artifacts. It normalizes
aliases, status, claim ceilings, owners, gates, and pre-hardware readiness so
claims and campaign plans can point to one row. Promotion rules are unchanged
from `docs/research_question_bank.md`: promotion still requires a named RQ slot
in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, a data plan that does not displace queue ranks above
it, and scope fit.

Maintenance rule: registry rows are LIVE state. The research question bank
remains the historical and deliberative record, including council wording,
kills, quarantines, and amendments. Single-writer split: update this registry
for current indexing and cross-references; update the bank only when recording
new deliberation history.

Column legend:

- `canonical_id`: stable row key for the live index.
- `aliases`: other IDs, names, or capability-map labels for the same question.
- `question_type`: one of `research question`, `capability claim`,
  `application idea`, or `methodology artifact`.
- `status`: `promoted`, `banked`, `candidate`, `killed`, `answered-L1`, or
  the review-specific `candidate (C-023)`.
- `claim_ceiling`: highest claim level currently allowed by the bank, review,
  or capability map, before future evidence upgrades.
- `forbidden_upgrade`: short reminder of language the row cannot support.
- `AP owner`: analysis-plan owner if already named; otherwise `none-yet`.
- `campaign owner`: queue row, phase, or campaign owner if already named.
- `gate_class`: dominant gate class: `hardware`, `software`, `floor`,
  `substrate`, or `coordination`.
- `pre_hardware_preparable`: `fully`, `analysis-plan-only`, or `no`.
- `one-line note`: indexing note, not a re-adjudication.

## Attribution Limits

The rows whose historical wording most invited over-attribution are:

- `C5-1.1`: active-parameter energy scaling. The C-014 amendment caps
  4-6-model designs at descriptive L2 pairwise contrasts unless the model set
  grows enough for a predeclared one-covariate fit, and forbids fitting
  active+total+KV covariates on 4-6 model points. The claims ladder also
  prevents L1 active-parameter-scaling language; the capability map records
  the current two-model observation as a non-claim.
- `C5-1.8`: runtime energy attribution. The bank already says comparisons
  where formats force different artifacts are stack-vs-stack comparisons.
  The registry therefore forbids wording that energy "belongs to the runtime"
  unless the artifact/runtime identity problem is actually controlled.

This subsection is hygiene for claims indexing. It does not re-adjudicate the
ratified C-014/C-015 bank decisions.
