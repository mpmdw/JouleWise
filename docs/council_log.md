# Council Log

Chronicle of multi-model review councils: sessions where more than one
model reviews, counterreviews, or votes on JouleWise work before it
lands. Companion to `docs/decision_log.md` (which records WHAT was
decided about the system; this file records HOW cross-model review
reached it). One entry per council session; keep entries concise —
positions, votes, resolutions, and follow-ups, not transcripts.

Standing council roles (adopted C-001; process decision D-031):

- **Claude (lead/orchestrator)** — scopes work, diagnoses live/hardware
  failures, runs adversarial review workflows, owns bookkeeping and the
  final merge decision, and is the only member that touches real
  hardware.
- **Codex / gpt-5.5 (peer implementer-reviewer)** — implements against
  pinned specs, counterreviews findings on its own code, reverse-reviews
  Claude's commits and orchestration decisions, and is asked for design
  judgment explicitly ("argue the tradeoffs before you code").
- **Opus subagents (fast reviewers)** — parallel lower-level sweeps
  (commit hygiene, docs consistency, fixture audits) whose findings feed
  the discussion; cheap enough to run every session.

Disagreements are discussed in at most one or two rounds; unresolved
disagreements are decided by the lead and recorded here with the
dissent. Anything user-facing (push/merge/publish) follows the user's
standing instructions.

## C-001: Review/counterreview adopted (Slice 2H)

- Date: 2026-07-06. Participants: Claude (lead), Codex gpt-5.5 (author +
  counterreviewer), 22 review/verification subagents.
- Shape: Codex implemented 2H → Claude live-verified → a three-lens
  adversarial review workflow (contract / correctness / test-adequacy;
  every finding survived an independent refutation attempt) confirmed
  10 findings (1 blocker, 6 should-fix, 3 nits) and refuted 2 → Codex
  counterreviewed as a peer.
- Votes/positions: Codex accepted all 10 findings (refuted none) and,
  invited to argue design before coding, proposed a better blocker fix
  than either option the lead posed (`AdapterFailure` structured
  exception; controller maps the true `FailureReason`).
- Resolution: all fixes applied; suite 251 green; live re-verified
  (fail-fast at idle_baseline, `permission_denied`, no fabricated
  baseline). Precedent: green tests are necessary, never sufficient —
  the blocker was invisible to a fully green suite.

## C-002: Reverse review of the vertical-slice series; push vs PR

- Date: 2026-07-07. Participants: Claude (lead), Codex gpt-5.5 (reverse
  reviewer of Claude's commits AND decisions), 2 Opus subagents (commit
  hygiene; docs consistency).
- Subject: the 9 unpushed commits (`10a570d`..`123d87a`) and five of
  Claude's orchestration decisions (flagship config mutation, 20 Hz mock
  workaround, provisional D-016 wording, main-branch convention,
  bookkeeping fidelity).
- Findings that survived: (1) stale gate-state prose in 6 files
  (Opus sweep + Codex independently convergent) — README/playbook test
  counts, phase-1 sudoers rows, phase-2 status paragraph contradicting
  its own matrix, PROJECT_STATUS blocked-items, wrong skip count, stale
  CI run number; (2) Codex-unique: the flagship config kept run_id
  `example-mac-mlx-local` across a workload-semantics change — explicit
  run_ids bypass hash suffixing, blurring provenance; (3) both reviewers
  independently: the committed sudoers line exposed the OS username.
  Commit hygiene otherwise CLEAN (messages match diffs, test-count chain
  reconciles, fixture justified, no secrets); CI risk assessed low
  (Codex ran the suite, config validation, and mock e2e itself).
- Discussion round (positions → resolution):
  - D1 flagship mutability: Claude held configs are entrypoints (run
    identity = config hash, D-022/D-029) but conceded the run_id rename
    (`example-mac-mlx-local-512t`); Codex concurred and withdrew the
    separate-config ask ("a committed known-unmeasurable config is a
    footgun"); the short-window finding lives in the 2I run report.
  - D2 P2-008 urgency: consensus rank 3 with a hard "before 2K/2L
    bring-up" gate (mock telemetry under SystemClock is now real-runtime
    test infrastructure); not above 2M/Stage 3.0, which don't touch the
    edge.
  - D3 bookkeeping drift (structural): consensus two-part fix — D-023
    extension (prose status summaries carry an as-of date and defer to
    checklist matrix rows; no re-narrated gate lists) + a standing
    end-of-session docs-consistency sweep by a fast subagent
    (RUN_STATE end-of-work step 7). This session is the proof: the sweep
    caught everything the peer reviewer caught.
  - Push vs PR: Codex recommended branch+PR (one GitHub-readable diff +
    CI before main for a mixed code/config/docs series); Claude accepted;
    unanimous. Convention adopted for multi-commit sessions (D-031).
- Pre-PR blockers (all applied in the fix-up commit): staleness fixes,
  run_id rename + hash pin, `<local_user>` genericization of the sudoers
  line in docs, this log, queue re-rank.
- Dissents: none outstanding.
- Follow-up (user direction, same day): next multi-stream batch
  (2M / P2-008 / kv-size) runs as parallel worktree streams, each owned
  by a Fable orchestrator subagent driving its own Codex thread, landing
  as separate PRs (D-031 execution-topology addendum).
